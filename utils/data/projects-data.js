    description: "Me and my team built an Flutter web application, with an ASP.NET API server that communicates with Firebase in order to assist therapists involved in Hippotherapy. The application has many roles to fulfill, firstly it must store patient information securely for therapists to manage their information. The therapists must also be able to do physical evaluations of their patients, and track changes in their posture overtime. There must also be an 'Owner' interface to this application as well for the people who will manage the therapists, and deal with exporting this data in an anonymous fashion for later analysis",

    description: "This was the final project in our web development class that I worked on with a partner. In creating this site our goal was to learn how to make a fully functional backend, that relies on dynamically generated data from user input. The backend API server we made was then responsible for fetching the data from NASA\'s publicly accessible API, and allowing our site visitors to authenticate as both regular and administrative users. Along with a little messaging system on our site\'s wall",
